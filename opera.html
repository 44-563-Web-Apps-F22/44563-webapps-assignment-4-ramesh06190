    <h3>ACT I - Ruined Temple on the Summit of Mount Olympus<br>
     Scene—The ruins of the The Temple of the Gods, on summit of Mount Olympus. Picturesque shattered columns, overgrown with ivy, etc. R. and L. with entrances to temple (ruined) R. Fallen columns on the stage.
     Three broken pillars 2 R.E.  At the back of stage is the approach from the summit of the mountain. This should be "practicable" to enable large numbers of people to ascend and descend.
     In the distance are the summits of adjacent mountains. At first all this is concealed by a thick fog, which clears presently. Enter (through fog) Chorus of Stars coming off
     duty as fatigued with their night's work.

    <P class="song">Through the night, the constellations,<br>
        Have given light from various stations.<br>
        When midnight gloom falls on all nations,<br>
        We will resume our occupations.<br></P>
    <h4 class="SOLO">SOLO.</h4>
    <p class="song">Our light, it's true, is not worth mention;<br>
       What can we do to gain attention.<br>
       When night and noon with vulgar glaring<br>
       A great big moon is always flaring.<br></p>
    <p class="direction">[During chorus, enter Diana, an elderly goddess. She is carefully
        wrapped up in cloaks, shawls, etc.  A hood is over her head, a
        respirator in her mouth, and galoshes on her feet. During the
        chorus, she takes these things off and discovers herself dressed
        in the usual costume of the Lunar Diana, the goddess of the moon.]</p>

    <p class="speech">[shuddering] Ugh. How cold the nights are.  I don't know how
  it is, but I seem to feel the night air a good deal more than I
  used to. But it is time for the sun to be rising. [Calls] Apollo.</p>
    <h4 class="AP">AP.</h4>
    <p class="speech">[within] Hollo.</p>

    <h4 class="DIA">DIA.</h4>
    <P class="speech">I've come off duty—it's time for you to be getting up.</P>
    <P id="direction">[Enter Apollo. He is an elderly "buck" with an air of assumed
        juvenility and is dressed in dressing gown and smoking cap.]</P>
    <h4 class="AP">AP.</h4>
    <P class="speech">[yawning] I shan't go out today. I was out yesterday and the
    day before and I want a little rest. I don't know how it is,but I
    seem to feel my work a great deal more than I used to.</P>
    <H4 class="DIA">DIA.</H4>
    <P class="speech">I am sure these short days can't hurt you.  Why you don't
    rise til six and you're in bed again by five; you should have a
    turn at my work and see how you like that—out all night.</P>
    <h4 class="AP">AP</h4>
    <p class="speech">My dear sister, I don't envy you—though I remember when I
    did—but that was when I was a younger sun.  I don't think I'm
    quite well.  Perhaps a little change of air will do me good. I've
    a mind to show myself in London this winter. They'll be very glad
    to see me. No. I shan't go out today. I shall send them this
    fine, thick wholesome fog and they won't miss me.  It's the best
    substitute for a blazing sun—and like most substitutes, nothing
    at all like the real thing.</p>
    <h4 class="MER">MER.</h4>
    <P class="speech">Home at last. A nice time I've had of it.</P>
    <H4 class="DIA">DIA.</H4>
    <P class="speech">You young scamp you've been out all night again. This is the
    third time you've been out this week.</P>
