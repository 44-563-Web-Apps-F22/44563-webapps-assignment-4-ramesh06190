    <h3>ACT I - Ruined Temple on the Summit of Mount Olympus<br>
     [Scene—The ruins of the The Temple of the Gods, on summit of Mount Olympus. Picturesque shattered columns, overgrown with ivy, etc. R. and L. with entrances to temple (ruined) R. Fallen columns on the stage.
     Three broken pillars 2 R.E.  At the back of stage is the approach from the summit of the mountain. This should be "practicable" to enable large numbers of people to ascend and descend.
     In the distance are the summits of adjacent mountains. At first all this is concealed by a thick fog, which clears presently. Enter (through fog) Chorus of Stars coming off
     duty as fatigued with their night's work.

        ACT I
  

  CHO.  Through the night, the constellations,
       Have given light from various stations.
       When midnight gloom falls on all nations,
       We will resume our occupations.

  SOLO. Our light, it's true, is not worth mention;
       What can we do to gain attention.
       When night and noon with vulgar glaring
       A great big moon is always flaring.

  [During chorus, enter Diana, an elderly goddess. She is carefully
  wrapped up in cloaks, shawls, etc.  A hood is over her head, a
  respirator in her mouth, and galoshes on her feet. During the
  chorus, she takes these things off and discovers herself dressed
  in the usual costume of the Lunar Diana, the goddess of the moon.

  DIA. [shuddering] Ugh. How cold the nights are.  I don't know how
  it is, but I seem to feel the night air a good deal more than I
  used to. But it is time for the sun to be rising. [Calls] Apollo.

  AP. [within] Hollo.

  DIA. I've come off duty—it's time for you to be getting up.

  [Enter Apollo. He is an elderly "buck" with an air of assumed
  juvenility and is dressed in dressing gown and smoking cap.

  AP. [yawning] I shan't go out today. I was out yesterday and the
  day before and I want a little rest. I don't know how it is,but I
  seem to feel my work a great deal more than I used to.

  DIA. I am sure these short days can't hurt you.  Why you don't
  rise til six and you're in bed again by five; you should have a
  turn at my work and see how you like that—out all night.

  AP. My dear sister, I don't envy you—though I remember when I
  did—but that was when I was a younger sun.  I don't think I'm
  quite well.  Perhaps a little change of air will do me good. I've
  a mind to show myself in London this winter. They'll be very glad
  to see me. No. I shan't go out today. I shall send them this
  fine, thick wholesome fog and they won't miss me.  It's the best
  substitute for a blazing sun—and like most substitutes, nothing
  at all like the real thing.

  [Fog clears away and discovers the scene described. Hurried
  music. Mercury shoots up from behind precipice at the back of
  stage. He carries several parcels afterwards described.  He sits
  down, very much fatigued.]

  MER. Home at last. A nice time I've had of it.

  DIA. You young scamp you've been out all night again. This is the
  third time you've been out this week.

  MER. Well you're a nice one to blow me up for that.

  DIA. I can't help being out all night.

  MER. And I can't help being down all night. The nature of Mercury
  requires that he should go down when the sun sets, and rise again
  when the sun rises.

  DIA. And what have you been doing?

  MER. Stealing on commission. There's a set of false teeth and a
  box of Life Pills for Jupiter—an invisible peruke and a bottle
  of hair dye—that's for Apollo—a respirator and a pair of
  galoshes—that's for Cupid—a full bottomed chignon, some
  auricomous fluid, a box of pearl-powder, a pot of rouge, and a
  hare's foot—that's for Venus.

  DIA. Stealing. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

  MER. Oh, as the god of thieves I must do something to justify my
  position.

  DIA.and AP. [contemptuously] Your position.

  MER. Oh, I know it's nothing to boast of even on earth.  Up here,
  it's simply contemptible.  Now that you gods are too old for your
  work, you've made me the miserable drudge of Olympus—groom,
  valet, postman, butler, commissionaire, maid of all work, parish
  beadle, and original dustman.

  AP. Your Christmas boxes ought to be something considerable.

  MER. They ought to be but they're not.  I'm treated abominably.
  I make everybody and I'm nobody.  I go everywhere and I'm
  nowhere.  I do everything and I'm nothing.  I've made thunder for
  Jupiter, odes for Apollo, battles for Mars, and love for Venus.
  I've married couples for Humen and six weeks afterwards, I've
  divorced them for Cupid, and in return I get all the kicks while
  they pocket the halfpence. And in compensation for robbing me of
  the halfpence in question, what have they done for me.

  AP. Why they've—ha.ha.ha. they've made you the god of thieves.

  MER. Very self denying of them.  There isn't one of them who
  hasn't a better claim to the distinction than I have.

       Oh, I'm the celestial drudge,
       For morning to night I must stop at it.
       On errands all day I must trudge,
       And stick to my work til I drop at it.
       In summer I get up at one.
       (As a good-natured donkey I'm ranked for it.)
       then I go and I light up the sun.
       And Phoebus Apollo gets thanked for it.
       Well, well, it's the way of the world.
       And will be through all its futurity.
       Though noodles are baroned and earled,
       There's nothing for clever obscurity.

       I'm the slave of the Gods, neck and heels,
       And I'm bound to obey, though I rate at 'em.
       And I not only order their meals,
       But I cook 'em and serve'em and wait at 'em.
       Then I make all their nectar, I do.
       (What a terrible liquor to rack us is.)
       And whenever I mix them a brew,
       Why all the thanksgivings are Bacchus's.
       Well, well, it's the way of the world, etc.....

       The reading and writing I teach.
       And spelling-books many I've edited.
       And for bringing those arts within reach,
       That donkey Minerva gets credited.
       Then I scrape at the stars with a knife,
       And plate-powder the moon (on the days for it).
       And I hear all the world and his wife
       Awarding Diana the praise for it.
       Well, well, it's the way of the world, etc....

  [After song—very loud and majestic music is heard]
